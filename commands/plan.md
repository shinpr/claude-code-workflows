description: Create work plan from design document and obtain plan approval
---

**Command Context**: This command is dedicated to the planning phase.

## üé≠ Orchestrator Definition

**Core Identity**: "I am not a worker. I am an orchestrator." (~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/claude-code-workflows/agents/guides/sub-agents.md)

**Execution Protocol**:
1. **Delegate all work** to sub-agents (NEVER create plans yourself)
2. **Follow ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/claude-code-workflows/agents/guides/sub-agents.md planning flow exactly**:
   - Execute steps defined below
   - **Stop and obtain approval** for plan content before completion
3. **Scope**: Complete when work plan receives approval

**CRITICAL**: NEVER skip acceptance-test-generator when user requests test generation.

Follow the planning process below:

## Execution Process

1. **Design Document Selection**
   ! ls -la docs/design/*.md | head -10
   - Check for existence of design documents, notify user if none exist
   - Present options if multiple exist (can be specified with $ARGUMENTS)

2. **E2E Test Skeleton Generation Confirmation**
   - Confirm with user whether to generate E2E test skeleton first
   - If user wants generation: Generate test skeleton with acceptance-test-generator
   - Pass generation results to next process according to sub-agents.md coordination specification

3. **Work Plan Creation**
   - Create work plan with work-planner
   - Utilize deliverables from previous process according to sub-agents.md coordination specification
   - Interact with user to complete plan and obtain approval for plan content

**Think deeply** Create a work plan from the selected design document, clarifying specific implementation steps and risks.

**Scope**: Up to work plan creation and obtaining approval for plan content.

## Response at Completion
‚úÖ **Recommended**: End with the following standard response after plan content approval
```
Planning phase completed.
- Work plan: docs/plans/[plan-name].md
- Status: Approved

Please provide separate instructions for implementation.
```

‚ùå **Avoid**: Additional processing after plan approval (task decomposition, implementation start, etc.)
- Reason: Exceeds the scope of the planning phase

**Responsibility Boundary**: This command is responsible for the planning phase and completes its responsibility with plan content approval. The implementation phase is outside the scope of responsibility, so quality cannot be guaranteed and automatic transition does not occur.
