# Language-Agnostic Testing Principles

## Core Testing Philosophy

1. **Tests are First-Class Code**: Maintain test quality equal to production code
2. **Fast Feedback**: Tests should run quickly and provide immediate feedback
3. **Reliability**: Tests should be deterministic and reproducible
4. **Independence**: Each test should run in isolation

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### The RED-GREEN-REFACTOR Cycle

**Always follow this cycle:**

1. **RED**: Write a failing test first
   - Write the test before implementation
   - Ensure the test fails for the right reason
   - Verify test can actually fail

2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass
   - Implement just enough to make the test pass
   - Don't optimize prematurely
   - Focus on making it work

3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code structure
   - Clean up implementation
   - Eliminate duplication
   - Improve naming and clarity
   - Keep all tests passing

4. **VERIFY**: Ensure all tests still pass
   - Run full test suite
   - Check for regressions
   - Validate refactoring didn't break anything

### TDD Benefits

- Better design through testability requirements
- Comprehensive test coverage by default
- Living documentation of expected behavior
- Confidence to refactor

## Quality Requirements

### Coverage Standards

- **Minimum 80% code coverage** for production code
- Prioritize critical paths and business logic
- Don't sacrifice quality for coverage percentage
- Use coverage as a guide, not a goal

### Test Characteristics

All tests must be:

- **Independent**: No dependencies between tests
- **Reproducible**: Same input always produces same output
- **Fast**: Complete test suite runs in reasonable time
- **Self-checking**: Clear pass/fail without manual verification
- **Timely**: Written close to the code they test

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

**Purpose**: Test individual components in isolation

**Characteristics**:
- Test single function, method, or class
- Fast execution (milliseconds)
- No external dependencies
- Mock external services
- Majority of your test suite

**Example Scope**:
```
✓ Test calculateTotal() function
✓ Test UserValidator class
✓ Test parseDate() utility
```

### Integration Tests

**Purpose**: Test interactions between components

**Characteristics**:
- Test multiple components together
- May include database, file system, or APIs
- Slower than unit tests
- Verify contracts between modules
- Smaller portion of test suite

**Example Scope**:
```
✓ Test UserService with Database
✓ Test API endpoint with authentication
✓ Test file processing pipeline
```

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests

**Purpose**: Test complete workflows from user perspective

**Characteristics**:
- Test entire application stack
- Simulate real user interactions
- Slowest test type
- Fewest in number
- Highest confidence level

**Example Scope**:
```
✓ Test user registration flow
✓ Test checkout process
✓ Test complete report generation
```

### Test Pyramid

Follow the test pyramid structure:
```
    /\    ← Few E2E Tests (High confidence, slow)
   /  \
  /    \  ← Some Integration Tests (Medium confidence, medium speed)
 /      \
/________\ ← Many Unit Tests (Fast, foundational)
```

## Test Design Principles

### AAA Pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)

Structure every test clearly:

```
// Arrange: Setup test data and conditions
const user = createTestUser()
const validator = new UserValidator()

// Act: Execute the code under test
const result = validator.validate(user)

// Assert: Verify expected outcome
assert(result.isValid === true)
```

### One Assertion Per Concept

- Test one behavior per test case
- Multiple assertions OK if testing single concept
- Split unrelated assertions into separate tests

**Good**:
```
test("validates user email format")
test("validates user age is positive")
test("validates required fields are present")
```

**Bad**:
```
test("validates user") // Tests everything at once
```

### Descriptive Test Names

Test names should clearly describe:
- What is being tested
- Under what conditions
- What the expected outcome is

**Format**: `test("should [expected behavior] when [condition]")`

**Examples**:
```
test("should return error when email is invalid")
test("should calculate discount when user is premium member")
test("should throw exception when file not found")
```

## Test Independence

### Isolation Requirements

- **No shared state**: Each test creates its own data
- **No execution order dependency**: Tests pass in any order
- **Clean up after tests**: Reset state, close connections
- **Avoid global variables**: Use local test data

### Setup and Teardown

- Use setup hooks to prepare test environment
- Use teardown hooks to clean up resources
- Keep setup minimal and focused
- Ensure teardown runs even if test fails

## Mocking and Test Doubles

### When to Use Mocks

- **Mock external dependencies**: APIs, databases, file systems
- **Mock slow operations**: Network calls, heavy computations
- **Mock unpredictable behavior**: Random values, current time
- **Mock unavailable services**: Third-party services

### Mocking Principles

- Mock at boundaries, not internally
- Keep mocks simple and focused
- Verify mock expectations when relevant
- Don't mock types you don't own (prefer adapters)

### Types of Test Doubles

- **Stub**: Returns predetermined values
- **Mock**: Verifies it was called correctly
- **Spy**: Records information about calls
- **Fake**: Simplified working implementation
- **Dummy**: Passed but never used

## Test Quality Practices

### Keep Tests Active

- **Never skip tests**: Fix or delete failing tests
- **No commented-out tests**: Delete or fix them
- **Keep tests running**: Broken tests lose value quickly
- **Maintain test suite**: Refactor tests as needed

### Test Code Quality

- Apply same standards as production code
- Use descriptive variable names
- Extract test helpers to reduce duplication
- Keep tests readable and maintainable
- Review test code thoroughly

### Test Helpers and Utilities

- Create reusable test data builders
- Extract common setup into helper functions
- Build test utilities for complex scenarios
- Share helpers across test files appropriately

## What to Test

### Focus on Behavior

**Test observable behavior, not implementation**:

✓ **Good**: Test that function returns expected output
✓ **Good**: Test that correct API endpoint is called
✗ **Bad**: Test that internal variable was set
✗ **Bad**: Test order of private method calls

### Test Public APIs

- Test through public interfaces
- Avoid testing private methods directly
- Test return values, outputs, exceptions
- Test side effects (database, files, logs)

### Test Edge Cases

Always test:
- **Boundary conditions**: Min/max values, empty collections
- **Error cases**: Invalid input, null values, missing data
- **Edge cases**: Special characters, extreme values
- **Happy path**: Normal, expected usage

## Verification Requirements

### Before Commit

- ✓ All tests pass
- ✓ No tests skipped or commented
- ✓ No debug code left in tests
- ✓ Test coverage meets standards
- ✓ Tests run in reasonable time

### Zero Tolerance Policy

- **Zero failing tests**: Fix immediately
- **Zero skipped tests**: Delete or fix
- **Zero flaky tests**: Make deterministic
- **Zero slow tests**: Optimize or split

## Test Organization

### File Structure

- **Mirror production structure**: Tests follow code organization
- **Clear naming**: `UserService.test.js`, `user_service_test.py`
- **Logical grouping**: Group related tests together
- **Separate test types**: Unit, integration, e2e in separate directories

### Test Suite Organization

```
tests/
├── unit/           # Fast, isolated unit tests
├── integration/    # Integration tests
├── e2e/            # End-to-end tests
├── fixtures/       # Test data and fixtures
└── helpers/        # Shared test utilities
```

## Performance Considerations

### Test Speed

- **Unit tests**: < 100ms each
- **Integration tests**: < 1s each
- **Full suite**: Should run frequently (< 10 minutes)

### Optimization Strategies

- Run tests in parallel when possible
- Use in-memory databases for tests
- Mock expensive operations
- Split slow test suites
- Profile and optimize slow tests

## Continuous Integration

### CI/CD Requirements

- Run full test suite on every commit
- Block merges if tests fail
- Run tests in isolated environments
- Test on target platforms/versions

### Test Reports

- Generate coverage reports
- Track test execution time
- Identify flaky tests
- Monitor test trends

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Test Smells

- ✗ Tests that test nothing (always pass)
- ✗ Tests that depend on execution order
- ✗ Tests that depend on external state
- ✗ Tests with complex logic (tests shouldn't need tests)
- ✗ Testing implementation details
- ✗ Excessive mocking (mocking everything)
- ✗ Test code duplication

### Flaky Tests

Eliminate tests that fail intermittently:
- Remove timing dependencies
- Avoid random data in tests
- Ensure proper cleanup
- Fix race conditions
- Make tests deterministic

## Regression Testing

### Prevent Regressions

- Add test for every bug fix
- Maintain comprehensive test suite
- Run full suite regularly
- Don't delete tests without good reason

### Legacy Code

- Add characterization tests before refactoring
- Test existing behavior first
- Gradually improve coverage
- Refactor with confidence

## Testing Best Practices by Language Type

### Statically Typed Languages

- Leverage type system for compile-time checks
- Test business logic, not types
- Use type-safe mocking frameworks

### Dynamically Typed Languages

- Add comprehensive runtime validation tests
- Test type handling explicitly
- Use property-based testing when applicable

### Functional Languages

- Test pure functions thoroughly
- Test side effects at boundaries
- Leverage property-based testing

### Object-Oriented Languages

- Test behavior through interfaces
- Mock dependencies via interfaces
- Test inheritance hierarchies carefully

## Documentation and Communication

### Tests as Documentation

- Tests document expected behavior
- Use clear, descriptive test names
- Include examples of usage
- Show edge cases and error handling

### Test Failure Messages

- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Include actual vs expected values
- Add context about what was being tested
- Make debugging easier

## Continuous Improvement

### Review and Refactor Tests

- Refactor tests as you refactor code
- Remove obsolete tests
- Improve test clarity
- Update tests for new patterns

### Learn from Failures

- Analyze test failures thoroughly
- Add tests for discovered edge cases
- Improve test coverage where gaps found
- Share learnings with team
